# NBA2K Trainer - Ready to Deploy

This is a simple Next.js (app router) starter project for a local-storage based NBA2K attribute trainer.

## How to run locally
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import this repository (or upload the ZIP) and deploy.

The app stores progress in the browser's localStorage (no backend). If you want server-side accounts or cloud saves, tell me and I can add a simple backend.
